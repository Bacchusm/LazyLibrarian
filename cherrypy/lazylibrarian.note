This is v3.6.0 of cherrypy slightly modified for lazylibrarian.
Later versions of cherrypy need additional libaries that we can't 
be sure are installed on all systems (eg NAS devices)

This version has a small change to _cpreqbody.py  line 1006
key = key.encode('ISO-8859-1')
changed to 
key = key.encode('utf-8')
as not all entries in POST forms are encodable in latin-1
eg magazine titles. Lazylibrarian config page causes an exception.
